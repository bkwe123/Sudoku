This is a sudoku solver that prints all possible solutions to the puzzle. It's a very common python project and there are many implementations. This one simply fills in squares with possible numbers until the solution is no longer viable at which point it backtracks to the most recent square where another number can be tried.

To enter a puzzle, edit the list called board in the sudoku.py file.
